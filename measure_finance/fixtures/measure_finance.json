This&nbsp;is because school and community college districts typically are required to make local contributions to their facilities if they want to obtain state funding. The exact effect on local behavior is uncertain. On the one hand, some school and community college districts might raise and spend more locally given the availability of additional state funds. As a result, more overall facility activity might occur in these districts over the next several years. In contrast, other school and community college districts might raise and spend less locally as the availability of additional state funds means they would not need to bear the full cost of their facility projects. These districts might complete the same number of projects as they would have absent a new state bond.

To date, the Legislature has extended the fee four times. Therefore, given past practice, it is possible the Legislature would have extended the hospital fee beyond January 1, 2018 in any case. There are also recent changes to federal law that may require changes to the structure of the hospital fee and these could affect the fiscal impact of the hospital fee. Below, we describe the fiscal effect of this measure under two main scenarios:</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">\n<li><em><strong>If Legislature Would Have Extended Hospital Fee Absent the Measure.</strong></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; font-weight: bold;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">&nbsp;</em></span>In this case, the measure would likely have relatively little fiscal effect on the state and local governments (for the period over which the Legislature extended the fee). This is because the state would already be generating General Fund savings and providing funding to public hospitals. We note, however, that absent this measure the Legislature could change the structure of the hospital fee such that the General Fund savings and public hospital benefit could be different from what it has been.</li>\n<li><em><strong>If Legislature Would&nbsp;Not&nbsp;Have Extended Hospital Fee Absent the Measure</strong></em>.<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">&nbsp;</em>In this case, the measure would have a major fiscal effect on the state and local governments. The fiscal effects under this scenario would likely be similar to those experienced recently (as adjusted for growth over time): (1) annual General Fund savings of about $1&nbsp;billion and (2) annual funding to the state and local public hospitals in the low hundreds of millions of dollars. The state and local governments also would realize some increased revenues as a result of the added federal funds brought into the state by the fee. These impacts, however, could be affected by new federal requirements that may require changes to the hospital fee. At this time, it is unclear what changes to the hospital fee would be necessary to comply with federal requirements. Any such changes could increase, decrease, or not change at all the impacts on the state and local governments.</li>\n</ul>", "official_financial_effect_author": "Legislative Analyst's Office", "official_impartial_analysis": "<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Makes Hospital Fee Permanent.</span></strong></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; font-weight: bold;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">&nbsp;</em></span>While the hospital fee would otherwise end under current state law on January 1, 2018, Proposition 52 extends the current fee permanently.

This is because the measure does not define a &ldquo;project.&rdquo; As a result, the courts and the state would have to make decisions about what they consider to be a single project. For example, in some cases a project could be narrowly defined as a single building (like a hospital). In other cases, a project could be more broadly defined as including multiple buildings in a larger complex (like a medical center). A broader definition could result in more projects meeting the $2&nbsp;billion requirement, thus requiring voter approval.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>How Government Agencies and Voters Respond Would Affect Costs</strong></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Government and Voters Could Take Different Actions.</span></strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">When a proposed project meets this measure&rsquo;s requirements for voter approval, governments and voters could respond in different ways. These responses, in turn, would determine the fiscal effects, if any, of this measure:</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">\n<li>On the one hand, if the state held an election and voters approved the project, the state could proceed with the project as planned using revenue bonds. As a result, there would be little fiscal effect from this measure.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, if voters rejected the project or the state chose not to hold an election as required by this measure, the state would not be able to use revenue bonds for the project. Without access to revenue bonds, the state and/or local governments might take other actions to meet the concerns the project was intended to address. They might (1) replace the large project with other smaller projects, (2) perform other activities that would reduce the need for the project, or (3) find other ways to pay for the project instead of using revenue bonds. These actions could result in either higher or lower net costs depending on the specific alternatives that governments pursued and how they compared to the original project proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Some Actions Could Result in Higher Costs.</span></strong></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; font-weight: bold;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">&nbsp;</em></span>Some types of government and voter response to this measure could result in higher costs for the state and local governments. For example, it could be more expensive in some cases for state and local governments to complete several smaller projects than it would have been for the state to build the original large project. This could happen if the large project was a more efficient way to meet the concerns that the project addressed.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">The state also could fund a project in a different way than revenue bonds that might be more expensive. For example, the state could partner with a private company that would sell bonds to fund the project. The state would then have to pay back the private company. This could result in higher costs for the state because the private company would need to make a profit on the project. Also, the private company would probably pay higher interest rates than the state. The private company would likely pass these higher borrowing costs on to the state.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Some Actions Could Result in Lower Costs</em></span></strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; font-weight: bold;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">.&nbsp;</em></span>Other types of responses could result in lower state and local costs. For example, state and local governments might find ways to make better use of existing infrastructure. For instance, local water agencies might implement water conservation measures, which could reduce the need to build new dams or other projects to provide more water. If existing infrastructure could meet the state&rsquo;s needs adequately with these types of actions, there would be savings from not having to spend the money to build a new project.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.6px; line-height: 19.04px;\">The state also could fund a project in a way that might be cheaper than using revenue bonds.

The excise tax increase would result in higher prices for consumers. As a result, consumers would reduce their consumption of cigarettes and other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. (Many consumers might also change the way they buy these products to avoid the tax.) The range in potential new revenue reflects uncertainty about how much consumers will reduce their purchases in response to higher prices. The low-range estimate ($1.3&nbsp;billion) assumes consumers have a stronger response to the tax than under the high-range estimate ($1.6&nbsp;billion). In future years, revenues may decline relative to 2017-18 due to changes in consumer choices.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Applying Excise Taxes on E-Cigarettes Also Would Generate Additional Revenue for Existing Tobacco Funds.</span></strong></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; font-weight: bold;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">&nbsp;</em></span>As noted earlier, the measure expands the definition of other tobacco products to include e-cigarettes.

After covering revenue losses resulting from the measure, the revenue available for specific activities funded by the measure&mdash;mostly health programs&mdash;would be between $1&nbsp;billion and $1.4&nbsp;billion. If cigarette use continues to decline, these amounts would be somewhat less in future years. In addition, much of the added spending on health programs would generate additional federal funding to the state.

However, consumers would buy less of these products as prices increase due to the measure&rsquo;s taxes. As a result, the effect of the measure on sales tax revenue could be positive, negative, or generally unchanged, depending on how consumers react. Under the measure, if the state or local governments received less sales tax revenue as a result of the measure&rsquo;s taxes, those losses would be replaced by the revenue raised by the measure.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong><em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Effects on Excise Tax Collection.&nbsp;</span></em></strong>As described in Figure&nbsp;4, the measure would provide additional funding to various state agencies to support state law enforcement. These funds would be used to support increased enforcement efforts to reduce tax evasion, counterfeiting, smuggling, and the unlicensed sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Such enforcement efforts would increase the amount of tax revenue. The funds also would be used to support efforts to reduce sales of tobacco products to minors, which would reduce revenue collection. As a result, the net effect on excise tax revenue from these enforcement activities is unclear. In addition, while cigarettes and other tobacco products&mdash;as currently defined&mdash;are covered by federal laws to prevent tax evasion, e-cigarettes are not covered. As a result, enforcement of state excise taxes on e-cigarettes may be more challenging if consumers purchase more of these products online to avoid the new taxes.</p>\n<h4 style=\"margin: 10px 0px; padding-top: 0px; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14.96px;\">Impact on State and Local Government Health Care Costs</h4>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1em; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.6px; line-height: 19.04px;\">The state and local governments in California incur costs for providing (1) health care for low\u2010income and uninsured persons and (2) health insurance coverage for state and local government employees and retirees.

Further, this measure provides funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs, and to the extent these programs are effective, this would further decrease consumption of tobacco products. The use of tobacco products has been linked to various adverse health effects by the federal health authorities and numerous scientific studies. Thus, this measure would reduce state and local government health care spending on tobacco\u2010related diseases over the long term.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1em; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.6px; line-height: 19.04px;\">This measure would have other fiscal effects that offset these cost savings.

Further, the impact of a tax on e\u2010cigarettes on health and the associated costs over the long term is unknown, because e\u2010cigarettes are relatively new devices and the health impacts of e\u2010cigarettes are still being studied.

The level of savings would depend heavily on the number of individuals BPH chose to release. Based on recent BPH experience with parole consideration for certain nonviolent offenders, we estimate that the ongoing fiscal impact of this provision would likely be state savings in the tens of millions of dollars annually. These savings would be offset somewhat by additional costs for BPH to conduct more parole considerations.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1em; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.6px; line-height: 19.04px;\">The measure would also result in temporary fiscal effects in the near term due to (1) additional savings from the release of offenders currently in prison who would be eligible for parole consideration and (2) an acceleration of parole costs to supervise those individuals who are released from prison earlier than otherwise.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1em; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.6px; line-height: 19.04px;\"><em><strong>Acceleration of County Costs.</strong></em>&nbsp;Because the measure would result in the early release of some individuals who are supervised by county probation officers following their release from prison, the measure would likely increase the size of the probation population in the near term.

Any level of savings is highly uncertain, as it would depend on how much average sentence lengths were reduced by CDCR. If the department granted enough credits to reduce the average time inmates serve by a few weeks, the measure could eventually result in state savings in the low tens of millions of dollars annually. However, the savings could be significantly higher or lower if the department made different decisions. Because the measure could result in the early release of some individuals who are supervised by state parole agents following release, the measure could temporarily increase the size of the parole population. The state, however, would eventually have incurred these parole costs even in the absence of the measure.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1em; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.6px; line-height: 19.04px;\"><em><strong>Acceleration of County Costs.</strong></em>&nbsp;Because the measure could result in the early release of some individuals who are supervised by county probation officers following their release from prison, the measure could increase the size of the probation population in the near term.

First, it would reduce state prison and parole costs as those youths would no longer spend any time in prison or be supervised by state parole agents following their release. In addition, because juvenile court proceedings are generally shorter than adult court proceedings, the measure would reduce state court costs. These savings would be partially offset by increased state juvenile justice costs as youths affected by the measure would generally spend a greater amount of time in state juvenile facilities. (As noted earlier, a portion of the cost of housing these youths in state juvenile facilities would be paid for by counties.) In total, we estimate that the net savings to the state from the above effects could be a few million dollars annually.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1em; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.6px; line-height: 19.04px;\"><em><strong>County Costs.</strong></em>&nbsp;If fewer youths are tried and convicted as adults, the measure would also have a number of fiscal effects on counties. First, as discussed above, counties would be responsible for paying a portion of the costs of housing these youths in state juvenile facilities. In addition, county probation departments would be responsible for supervising these youths following their release. Since juvenile court proceedings are generally shorter than adult court proceedings, the above county costs would be partially offset by some savings. For example, county agencies involved in court proceedings for these youths&mdash;such as district attorneys, public defenders, and county probation&mdash;would experience a reduction in workload.&nbsp;<strong>In total, we estimate that the net costs to counties due to the above effects would likely be a few million dollars annually.</strong></p>\n<h4 style=\"margin: 10px 0px; padding-top: 0px; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14.96px;\">Other Fiscal Effects</h4>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1em; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13.6px; line-height: 19.04px;\">The measure could also affect crime rates in varying ways. On the one hand, if the measure results in offenders spending less time in prison and more time in the community, it could result in these offenders committing additional crimes or crimes sooner than they otherwise would have. On the other hand, the measure could lead to more offenders participating in educational and rehabilitative programs that reduce the likelihood of them committing crimes in the future. The net effect of the above factors is unknown.</p>", "official_financial_effect_author": "Legislative Analyst's Office", "official_impartial_analysis": "<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">This measure makes changes to the State Constitution to increase the number of inmates eligible for parole consideration and authorizes CDCR to award sentencing credits to inmates.

Although the measure and current law do not specify which felony crimes are defined as nonviolent, this analysis assumes a nonviolent felony offense would include any felony offense that is not specifically defined in statute as violent. As of September 2015, there were about 30,000 individuals in state prison who would be affected by the parole consideration provisions of the measure. In addition, about 7,500 of the individuals admitted to state prison each year would be eligible for parole consideration under the measure. Individuals who would be affected by the above changes currently serve about two years in prison before being considered for parole and/or released. Under the measure, we estimate that these individuals would serve around one and one-half years in prison before being considered for parole and/or released.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Authority to Award Credits.</span></strong></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; font-weight: bold;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">&nbsp;</em></span>The measure also changes the State Constitution to give CDCR the authority to award credits to inmates for good behavior and approved rehabilitative or educational achievements.

As a result, the only way a youth could be tried in adult court is if the juvenile court judge in the hearing decides to transfer the youth to adult court. Youths accused of committing certain severe crimes would no longer automatically be tried in adult court and no youth could be tried in adult court based only on the decision of a prosecutor. In addition, the measure specifies that prosecutors can only seek transfer hearings for youths accused of (1) committing certain significant crimes listed in state law (such as murder, robbery, and certain sex offenses) when they were age 14&nbsp;or 15 or (2) committing a felony when they were 16 or 17.

This is because, at least for some drugs, the VA has negotiated a lower price than that shown in the public database and is keeping that pricing information confidential. It is uncertain whether the VA could be nonetheless required to disclose these lower prices to an entity&mdash;such as DHCS&mdash;requesting such information under a federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. A FOIA exemption covering trade secrets and financial information may apply to prevent the VA from having to disclose these currently confidential prices to the state.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Confidentiality of VA Drug Prices Could Compromise the State&rsquo;s Ability to Implement the Measure.</span></strong></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; font-weight: bold;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">&nbsp;</em></span>If the VA is legally allowed to keep some of its prescription drug pricing information confidential, DHCS would be unable to assess in all cases whether state agencies are paying less than or equal to the lowest price paid by the VA for the same drug. This would limit the state&rsquo;s ability to implement the measure as it is written. However, to address challenges in implementing laws, courts sometimes grant state agencies latitude to implement laws to the degree that is practicable as long as implementation is consistent with the laws&rsquo; intent. For example, courts might allow the state to pay for drugs at a price not exceeding the lowest&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">known</em>&nbsp;price paid by the VA, rather than the actual lowest price, to allow the measure to be implemented.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Potential Confidentiality of Lowest VA Drug Prices Reduces but Does Not Eliminate Potential State Savings.&nbsp;</span></strong></em>The potential confidentiality of at least some of the lowest VA prices reduces but does not eliminate the measure&rsquo;s potential to generate savings related to state prescription drug spending. Though pricing information may be unavailable for some of the VA&rsquo;s lowest-priced prescription drugs, publicly available VA drug prices have historically been lower than the prices paid by some California state agencies for some drugs. To the extent that the VA&rsquo;s publicly available drug prices for particular drugs are lower than those paid by California state agencies and manufacturers choose to offer these prices to the state, the measure would help the state achieve prescription drug-related savings.</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>Potential Drug Manufacturer Responses Limit Potential Savings</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Drug Manufacturer Responses Under Measure Could Significantly Affect Fiscal Impact.</span>&nbsp;</strong></em>In order to maintain similar levels of profits on their products, drug manufacturers would likely take actions that mitigate the impact of the measure. A key reason why drug manufacturers might take actions in response to the measure relates to how federal law regulates state Medicaid programs&rsquo; prescription drug prices. (Medi-Cal is California&rsquo;s Medicaid program.) Federal law entitles all state Medicaid programs to the lowest prescription drug prices available to most public and private payers in the United States (excluding certain payers, such as the VA). If certain California state agencies receive VA prices, as the measure intends, this would set new prescription drug price limits at VA prices for&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">all</em>&nbsp;state Medicaid programs. As a result, the measure could extend the VA&rsquo;s favorable drug prices to health programs serving tens of millions of additional people nationwide, placing added pressure on drug manufacturers to take actions to protect their profits under the measure.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Below are two possible manufacturer responses. (We note that manufacturers might ultimately pursue both strategies, while at the same time offering some drugs at favorable VA prices.)</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">\n<li><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Drug Manufacturers Might Raise VA Drug Prices.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;Knowing that the measure makes VA prices the upper limit for what the state can pay, drug manufacturers might choose to raise VA drug prices. This would allow drug manufacturers to continue to offer prescription drugs to state agencies while minimizing any reductions to their profits. Should manufacturers respond in this manner, potential savings related to state prescription drug spending would be reduced.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; border-top-left-radius: 0px !important; border-top-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-top-left-radius: 0px !important; border-top-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; line-height: 24px;\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-top-left-radius: 0px !important; border-top-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\"><strong><em>Drug Manufacturers Might Decline to Offer Lowest VA Prices to the State for Some Drugs.</em></strong>&nbsp;The measure places no requirement on drug manufacturers to offer prescription drugs to the state at the lowest VA prices. Rather, the measure restricts actions that the&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-top-left-radius: 0px !important; border-top-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">state</em>&nbsp;can take (namely, prohibiting the state from paying more than the lowest VA prices for prescription drugs). Therefore, if manufacturers decide it is in their interest not to extend the VA&rsquo;s favorable pricing to California state agencies (for example, to avoid consequences such as those described above), drug manufacturers could decline to offer the state some drugs purchased by the VA. In such cases, these drugs would be unavailable to most state payers. Instead, the state would be limited to paying for drugs that either the VA does not purchase or drugs that manufacturers will offer at the lowest VA prices. (However, to comply with federal law, Medi-Cal might have to disregard the measure&rsquo;s price limits and pay for prescription drugs regardless of whether manufacturers offer their drugs at or below VA prices.) This manufacturer response could reduce potential state savings under the measure since it might limit the drugs the state can pay for to those that, while meeting the measure&rsquo;s price requirements, are actually more expensive than those currently paid for by the state.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-top-left-radius: 0px !important; border-top-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Summary of Overall Fiscal Effect</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; border-top-left-radius: 0px !important; border-top-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px !important; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">As discussed above, if adopted, the measure could generate annual state savings.

For example, jury selection time for some trials could be reduced as it would no longer be necessary to remove potential jurors who are unwilling to impose the death penalty. Second, the elimination of the death penalty would reduce the costs incurred by counties for prosecutors and public defenders for some murder cases. This is because these agencies generally use more attorneys in cases where a death sentence is sought and incur greater expenses related to investigations and other preparations for the sentencing phase in such cases.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">County Jails</span></strong></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; font-weight: bold;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">.&nbsp;</em></span>County jail costs could also be reduced because of the measure&rsquo;s effect on murder trials. Persons held for trial on murder charges, particularly cases that could result in a death sentence, ordinarily remain in county jail until the completion of their trial and sentencing. As some murder cases are shortened due to the elimination of the death penalty, persons convicted of murder would be sent to state prison earlier than they otherwise would be. Such an outcome would reduce county jail costs and increase state prison costs.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong><em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Summary of Impacts Related to Murder Trials.</span></em></strong>&nbsp;In total, the measure could reduce annual state and county costs for murder trials by several tens of millions of dollars on a statewide basis. The actual reduction would depend on various factors, including the number of death penalty trials that would otherwise have occurred in the absence of the measure. In addition, the amount of this reduction could be partially offset to the extent that the elimination of the death penalty reduced the incentive for offenders to plead guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence in some murder cases. If additional cases went to trial instead of being resolved through plea agreements, the state and counties would experience additional costs for support of courts, prosecution, and defense attorneys, as well as county jails. The extent to which this would occur is unknown. In most cases, the state and counties would likely redirect available resources resulting from the above cost reductions to other court and law enforcement activities.</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>Legal Challenges to Death Sentences</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Over time, the measure would reduce state expenditures by the California Supreme Court and the state agencies participating in the legal challenges to death sentences. These reduced costs would reach about $55&nbsp;million annually. However, these reduced costs likely would be partially offset in the short run because some state expenditures would probably continue until the courts resolved all cases for inmates who previously received death sentences. In the long run, there would be relatively minor state and local costs&mdash;possibly totaling a couple million dollars annually&mdash;for hearing appeals from additional offenders receiving sentences of life without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>State Prisons</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">The elimination of the death penalty would affect state prison costs in different ways. On the one hand, its elimination would result in a somewhat higher prison population and higher costs as formerly condemned inmates are sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Given the length of time that inmates currently spend on death row, these costs would likely not be significant. On the other hand, these added costs likely would be more than offset by reduced costs from not housing hundreds of inmates on death row. As previously discussed, it is generally more expensive to house an inmate under a death sentence than an inmate subject to life without the possibility of parole, due to the higher security measures used to house and supervise inmates sentenced to death.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">The combined effect of these fiscal impacts would likely result in net state savings for the operation of the state&rsquo;s prison system in the low tens of millions of dollars annually.

This measure specifies that every person found guilty of murder must work while in state prison and have their pay deducted for any debts they owe to victims of crime, subject to state regulations. Because the measure does not change state regulations, existing prison practices related to inmate work requirements would not necessarily be changed. In addition, the measure increases from 50&nbsp;percent to 60&nbsp;percent the maximum amount that may be deducted from the wages of inmates sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for any debts owed to victims of crime.

(This legislation was enacted pursuant to the provision of Proposition&nbsp;63 allowing for changes that are &ldquo;consistent with and further the intent&rdquo; of the proposition, as described earlier.) Specifically, under the legislation: (1)&nbsp;ammunition dealers would be required to check with DOJ that individuals seeking to buy ammunition are not prohibited persons at the time of purchase and (2)&nbsp;DOJ could generally charge such individuals up to $1&nbsp;per transaction. These provisions are similar to current law. Fewer individuals, however, would be exempt from this check than under current law. For example, individuals permitted to carry concealed weapons would be subject to this check.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Licenses to Sell Ammunition.&nbsp;</span></strong></em>Similar to current law, Proposition&nbsp;63 requires individuals and businesses to obtain a one-year license from DOJ to sell ammunition. However, the measure changes the types of individuals and businesses that would be exempt from obtaining a license. For example, the measure generally exempts individuals and businesses that sell a small number of rounds of ammunition from the requirement to get a license. The measure also makes various changes in the penalties for failure to follow ammunition sale requirements. For example, it establishes a new criminal penalty&mdash;specifically, a misdemeanor&mdash;for failing to follow vendor licensing requirements.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong><em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Other Ammunition Requirements.&nbsp;</span></em></strong>This measure prohibits most California residents from bringing ammunition into the state without first having the ammunition delivered to a licensed ammunition dealer beginning in January 2018&mdash;a year and a half earlier than under current law. Additionally, failure to comply with this requirement would change from a misdemeanor to an infraction (punishable by a fine) for the first offense and either an infraction or a misdemeanor for any additional offense. The measure also requires DOJ to store certain ammunition sales information in a database indefinitely, rather than for two years.</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>Creates New Court Process for Removal of Firearms</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">This measure creates a new court process to ensure that individuals convicted of offenses that prohibit them from owning firearms do not continue to have them. Beginning in 2018, the measure requires courts to inform offenders upon conviction that they must (1)&nbsp;turn over their firearms to local law enforcement, (2)&nbsp;sell the firearms to a licensed firearm dealer, or (3)&nbsp;give the firearms to a licensed firearm dealer for storage. The measure also requires courts to assign probation officers to report on what offenders have done with their firearms. If the court finds that there is probable cause that an offender still has firearms, it must order that the firearms be removed. Finally, local governments or state agencies could charge a fee to reimburse them for certain costs in implementing the measure (such as those related to the removal or storage of firearms).</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>Implements Other Provisions</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Reporting Requirements.</span></strong></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; font-weight: bold;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">&nbsp;</em></span>The measure includes a number of reporting requirements related to firearms and ammunition. For example, the measure requires that ammunition dealers report the loss or theft of ammunition within 48 hours. It also requires that most individuals report the loss or theft of firearms within five days to local law enforcement. An individual who does not make such a report within five days would be guilty of an infraction for the first two violations. Additional violations would be a misdemeanor. This measure also reduces the penalty for an individual who knowingly submits a false report to local law enforcement from a misdemeanor to an infraction and eliminates the prohibition from owning firearms for ten years for such an individual. This measure also requires DOJ to submit the name, date of birth, and physical description of any newly prohibited person to NICS.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Large Capacity Magazines.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;Since 2000, state law has generally banned individuals from obtaining large capacity magazines (defined as those holding more than ten rounds of ammunition). The law, however, allowed individuals who had large capacity magazines before 2000 to keep them for their own use. Beginning July 2017, recently enacted law will prohibit most of these individuals from possessing these magazines. Individuals who do not comply are guilty of an infraction. However, there are various individuals who will be exempt from this requirement&mdash;such as an individual who owns a firearm (obtained before 2000) that can only be used with a large capacity magazine. Proposition&nbsp;63 eliminates several of these exemptions, as well as increases the maximum penalty for possessing large capacity magazines. Specifically, individuals who possess such magazines after July 2017 would be guilty of an infraction or a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Penalty for Theft of Firearms.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;Under current state law, the penalty for theft of firearms worth $950 or less is generally a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in county jail. Under this measure, such a crime would be a felony and could be punishable by up to three years in state prison.

This is primarily related to a decline in the number of offenders held in state prisons and county jails for growing and selling marijuana. The measure would also reduce the number of such offenders placed under community supervision (such as county probation). In addition, the measure would likely reduce other criminal justice costs, such as state court costs for the handling of related criminal cases.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">The above cost reductions would be partially offset by increased costs in several areas. In particular, the courts would incur costs to process applications from individuals seeking to be resentenced or have their criminal records changed. In addition, there would be costs to supervise resentenced offenders in the community. These various costs would be incurred largely within the first couple of years following the passage of the measure. In addition, there would be ongoing costs in a few areas. For example, there would be court costs to destroy records of arrest and conviction for individuals who commit certain marijuana-related crimes. In addition, there would be ongoing costs to operate drug education and counseling programs as required by the measure. There would also be some increased criminal justice costs (such as county jail and state court costs) to the extent that increased marijuana use leads to increased marijuana-related crime (such as driving while impaired by marijuana).</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">In total, the net reduction in state and local criminal justice costs from the above changes could be in the tens of millions of dollars annually.

For example, the measure could result in an increase in the number of individuals seeking publicly funded substance use treatment. Any additional costs for such services could be partially or entirely offset by additional funding that would be available for substance use treatment under the measure. Although research on the health effects of marijuana use is limited, there is some evidence that smoking marijuana has harmful effects. For example, marijuana smoke is among a list of substances identified by the state to cause cancer. To the extent that an increase in marijuana use negatively affects users&rsquo; health, it would increase somewhat state and local health program costs.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Increased State Regulatory Costs.</span>&nbsp;</strong></em>The measure would also result in costs for the state to regulate nonmedical marijuana businesses. These costs would vary depending on how the state chooses to regulate marijuana but could amount to several tens of millions of dollars annually. Eventually, these costs would likely be entirely offset by license fees and tax revenues.</p>\n<h3><strong>Effects on State and Local Revenues</strong></h3>\n<p><em><strong>Tax Revenues Could Reach $1&nbsp;Billion Annually, but Not Right Away.</strong></em> State and local governments would receive more revenues&mdash;including sales, excise, and income taxes&mdash;from marijuana sales allowed under this measure. This increase in tax revenue would result primarily from (1)&nbsp;new state excise taxes on growing and selling marijuana, (2)&nbsp;individuals switching from illegal purchases of marijuana (made from individuals who do not pay all the taxes they owe) to legal purchases (at businesses that collect and pay the taxes they owe), and (3)&nbsp;an increase in consumption of marijuana. In addition, lower marijuana prices due to the measure may provide individuals using marijuana now with some savings. This could allow them to purchase other legal products that generate tax revenue. These revenue increases, however, would be partially offset by the loss of sales taxes now collected on medical marijuana sales, as the measure exempts such purchases from these taxes.</p>\n<p>In total, our best estimate is that the state and local governments could eventually collect net additional revenues ranging from the high hundreds of millions of dollars to over $1&nbsp;billion annually. However, the revenues are likely to be significantly lower in the first several years following the passage of the measure. This is because it will take a couple of years for the state to issue licenses to marijuana businesses. In addition, it will likely take time for newly licensed businesses to set up efficient production and distribution systems. Prices in the legal market will likely fall as more legal businesses are licensed and as they become more efficient. As this occurs, more consumers will begin purchasing marijuana legally. It is unknown precisely how long this process will take but it could be several years after the measure passes before revenues reach the range described above. As discussed earlier, the measure requires that most of these funds be spent on specified purposes.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Additional Local Government Revenues.</strong></em> The measure could result in additional revenues if local governments impose taxes on marijuana. The amount of additional revenues could vary significantly, depending primarily on how many local governments impose marijuana taxes and at what rates. These revenues could easily amount to tens of millions of dollars annually.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Potential Impact on Local Economies in Marijuana Producing Areas.</strong> </em>Exports of marijuana currently contribute significantly to the economy in parts of Northern California, such as Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity Counties. Precisely how this measure would affect these local economies is unknown. Lower marijuana prices and more opportunity for legal cultivation elsewhere could hurt the economy in these areas, reducing local government tax revenues. If, however, local growers and businesses successfully marketed their marijuana products as premium goods, consumers might be willing to pay above-average prices for them. If that occurred, it could help offset some of the negative economic effects in those areas.<u></u></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">&nbsp;</p>", "official_financial_effect_author": "Legislative Analyst's Office", "official_impartial_analysis": "<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">This measure</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. legalizes adult nonmedical use of marijuana&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">2. creates a system for regulating nonmedical marijuana businesses</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">3. imposes taxes on marijuana, and</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">4. changes penalties for marijuana-related crimes.</span></p>\n<div style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">These changes are described below.</div>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>Legalization of Adult Nonmedical Use of Marijuana</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong><em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Personal Use of Nonmedical Marijuana.</span></em></strong>&nbsp;This measure changes state law to legalize the use of marijuana for nonmedical purposes by adults age 21 and over.

Businesses could generally not be located within 600 feet of a school, day care center, or youth center, unless allowed by a local government. In addition, businesses selling marijuana could not sell tobacco or alcohol. Under the measure, local governments could authorize licensed businesses to allow on-site consumption of marijuana. However, such businesses could not allow consumption in areas within the presence or sight of individuals under the age of 21 or areas visible from a public place. In addition, businesses allowing on-site marijuana consumption could not allow consumption of alcohol or tobacco.</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>Regulation of Nonmedical Marijuana Businesses</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">State Regulation of Nonmedical Marijuana Businesses.</span>&nbsp;</strong></em>This measure changes the name of the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation to the Bureau of Marijuana Control and makes it also responsible for regulating and licensing nonmedical marijuana businesses. In addition, the measure requires other state agencies to regulate and license different parts of the nonmedical marijuana industry. These state agencies would have responsibilities similar to the ones they currently have for medical marijuana. The measure requires each licensing agency to charge fees that cover its marijuana regulatory costs. Under the measure, the system for tracking medical marijuana products that must be developed under current law would be expanded to include marijuana for nonmedical use. The measure also creates the Marijuana Control Appeals Panel to hear appeals from individuals affected by a decision of the state&rsquo;s regulatory agencies. Decisions of the panel could be appealed to the courts.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Local Regulation of Nonmedical Marijuana Businesses.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;Under the measure, cities and counties could regulate nonmedical marijuana businesses.

Cities and counties could also completely ban marijuana-related businesses. However, they could not ban the transportation of marijuana through their jurisdictions.</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>Taxation of Marijuana</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">The measure imposes new state taxes on growing and selling both medical and nonmedical marijuana.

First, legalizing the sale of nonmedical marijuana will result in new sales tax revenue. (This would happen automatically, as generally products are subject to this tax under current law.) Second, the sale of medical marijuana, which is currently subject to sales tax, is specifically exempted from that tax. The measure does not change local governments&rsquo; existing ability to place other taxes on medical marijuana and does not restrict their ability to tax nonmedical marijuana.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Beginning in 2020, the tax on growing marijuana would be adjusted annually for inflation. The measure also allows the state Board of Equalization to annually adjust the tax rate for marijuana leaves to reflect changes in the price of marijuana flowers relative to leaves. In addition, the measure allows the board to establish other categories of marijuana (such as frozen marijuana) for tax purposes and specifies that these categories would be taxed at their value relative to marijuana flowers.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Allocation of Certain State Tax Revenues.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;Revenues collected from the new state retail excise tax and the state tax on growing marijuana would be deposited in a new state account, the California Marijuana Tax Fund. Certain fines on businesses or individuals who violate regulations created by the measure would also be deposited into this fund. Monies in the fund would first be used to pay back certain state agencies for any marijuana regulatory costs not covered by license fees. A portion of the monies would then be allocated in specific dollar amounts for various purposes, as shown in Figure&nbsp;4.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2016/prop64-fig4.png\" target=\"_blank\">Figure 4</a></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">All remaining revenues (the vast majority of monies deposited in the fund) would be allocated as follows:</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">\n<li>60&nbsp;percent for youth programs&mdash;including substance use disorder education, prevention, and treatment.</li>\n<li>20&nbsp;percent to clean up and prevent environmental damage resulting from the illegal growing of marijuana.</li>\n<li>20&nbsp;percent for (1) <span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">programs designed to reduce driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs and (2) </span><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\">a grant program designed to reduce any potential negative impacts on public health or safety resulting from the measure.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>Penalties for Marijuana-Related Crimes</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Change in Penalties for Future Marijuana Crimes.</span>&nbsp;</strong></em>The measure changes state marijuana penalties. For example, possession of one ounce or less of marijuana is currently punishable by a $100 fine. Under the measure, such a crime committed by someone under the age of 18 would instead be punishable by a requirement to attend a drug education or counseling program and complete community service. In addition, selling marijuana for nonmedical purposes is currently punishable by up to four years in state prison or county jail. Under the measure, selling marijuana without a license would be a crime generally punishable by up to six months in county jail and/or a fine of up to $500. In addition, individuals engaging in any marijuana business activity without a license would be subject to a civil penalty of up to three times the amount of the license fee for each violation. While the measure changes penalties for many marijuana-related crimes, the penalties for driving a vehicle while under the impairment of marijuana would remain the same. The measure also requires the destruction&mdash;within two years&mdash;of criminal records for individuals arrested or convicted for certain marijuana-related offenses.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><em><strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Individuals Previously Convicted of Marijuana Crimes.</span>&nbsp;</strong></em>Under the measure, individuals serving sentences for activities that are made legal or are subject to lesser penalties under the measure would be eligible for resentencing. For example, an offender serving a jail or prison term for growing or selling marijuana could have their sentence reduced. (A court would not be required to resentence someone if it determined that the person was likely to commit certain severe crimes.) Qualifying individuals would be resentenced to whatever punishment they would have received under the measure. Resentenced individuals currently in jail or prison would be subject to community supervision (such as probation) for up to one year following their release, unless a court removes that requirement. In addition, individuals who have completed sentences for crimes that are reduced by the measure could apply to the courts to have their criminal records changed.</p>", "official_impartial_analysis_author": "Legislative Analyst's Office", "official_tax_rate": "", "official_tax_rate_author": "", "official_short_arguments_yes": "", "official_short_arguments_no": "", "official_short_arguments_source": "", "official_rebuttal_yes": "<p>Proposition 64, in effect, could limit a 45-year ban on smoking ads on television, allowing marijuana ads airing to millions of children and teen viewers.

This is because the actual cost could vary significantly depending on four key factors: (1) the complexity of the legal challenges filed, (2) how state courts address existing and new legal challenges, (3)&nbsp;the availability of attorneys to represent condemned inmates, and (4) whether additional attorneys will be needed to process each legal challenge.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">On the one hand, the measure could reduce the cost of each legal challenge. For example, the requirement that each challenge generally be completed in five years, as well as the limits on the number of habeas corpus petitions that can be filed, could result in the filing of fewer, shorter legal documents. Such a change could result in each legal challenge taking less time and state resources to process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">On the other hand, some of the measure&rsquo;s provisions could increase state costs for each legal challenge. For example, the additional layers of review required for a habeas corpus petition could result in additional time and resources for the courts to process each legal challenge. In addition, there could be additional attorney costs if the state determines that a new attorney must be appointed when a habeas corpus petition ruling by the trial courts is appealed to the Courts of Appeal.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">In view of the above, the ongoing annual fiscal impact of the measure on state costs related to legal challenges to death sentences is unknown.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong><em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Near-Term Annual Cost Increases From Accelerated Spending on Existing Cases. </span></em></strong>Regardless of how the measure affects the cost of each legal challenge, the measure would accelerate the amount the state spends on legal challenges to death sentences. This is because the state would incur annual cost increases in the near term to process hundreds of pending legal challenges within the time limits specified in the measure. The state would save similar amounts in future years as some or all of these costs would have otherwise occurred over a much longer term absent this measure. Given the significant number of pending cases that would need to be addressed, the actual amount and duration of these accelerated costs in the near term is unknown. It is possible, however, that such costs could be in the tens of millions of dollars annually for many years.</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>State Prisons</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">To the extent that the state changes the way it houses condemned inmates, the measure could result in state prison savings. For example, if male inmates were transferred to other prisons instead of being housed in single cells at San Quentin, it could reduce the cost of housing and supervising these inmates. In addition, to the extent the measure resulted in additional executions that reduced the number of condemned inmates, the state would also experience additional savings.

This measure specifies that every person under a sentence of death must work while in state prison, subject to state regulations. Because the measure does not change state regulations, existing prison practices related to inmate work requirements would not necessarily be changed. In addition, the measure requires that 70&nbsp;percent of any money condemned inmates receive be used to pay any debts owed to victims.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; text-align: justify;\"><strong><em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">Enforcement of Death Sentence.</span></em></strong><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important; font-weight: bold;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">&nbsp;</em></span>The measure allows the state to house condemned inmates in any prison. The measure also exempts the state&rsquo;s execution procedures from the Administrative Procedures Act. In addition, the measure makes various changes regarding the method of execution used by the state. For example, legal challenges to the method could only be heard in the court that imposed the death sentence. In addition, if such challenges were successful, the measure requires the trial court to order a valid method of execution. In cases where federal court orders prevent the state from using a given method of execution, the state prisons would be required to develop a method of execution that meets federal requirements within 90 days. Finally, the measure exempts various health care professionals that assist with executions from certain state laws and disciplinary actions by licensing agencies, if those actions are imposed as a result of assisting with executions.</p>", "official_impartial_analysis_author": "Legislative Analyst's Office", "official_tax_rate": "", "official_tax_rate_author": "", "official_short_arguments_yes": "", "official_short_arguments_no": "", "official_short_arguments_source": "", "official_rebuttal_yes": "<p>Prop. 66 is a poorly-written and COSTLY EXPERIMENT that would INCREASE CALIFORNIA&rsquo;S RISK OF EXECUTING AN INNOCENT PERSON, add new layers of government bureaucracy and create even more legal delays in death penalty cases.</p>\n<p>**Read the measure for yourself: According to the state&rsquo;s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office, this measure could cost taxpayers TENS of MILLIONS of DOLLARS.</p>\n<p>Prop. 66 is not real reform.

This charge would not apply to bags used for certain purposes&mdash;such as bags used for prescription medicines. In addition, certain low-income customers would not have to pay this charge. Under the measure, stores would retain the revenue from the sale of the bags. They could use the proceeds to cover the costs of providing carryout bags, complying with the measure, and educational efforts to encourage the use of reusable bags.</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1; color: #333333; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><strong>Another Proposition on This Ballot Could Affect Implementation of This Measure</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\">This ballot includes another measure&mdash;Proposition&nbsp;65&mdash;that could direct revenue from carryout bag sales to the state if approved by voters.

Figure&nbsp;1 shows how the major provisions of SB&nbsp;270 would be implemented differently depending on different voter decisions on the two measures. Specifically, if Proposition&nbsp;67 (this referendum on SB&nbsp;270) gets more &ldquo;yes&rdquo; votes, the revenue would be kept by stores for specified purposes. However, if Proposition&nbsp;65 (initiative) gets more &ldquo;yes&rdquo; votes, the revenue would be used for environmental programs. We note that Proposition&nbsp;65 includes a provision that could be interpreted by the courts as preventing SB&nbsp;270 from going into effect at all should both measures pass and Proposition&nbsp;65 gets more &ldquo;yes&rdquo; votes. However, this analysis assumes that the other provisions of SB&nbsp;270 not related to the use of revenues&mdash;such as the requirement to ban single-use plastic carryout bags and charge for other bags&mdash;would still be implemented.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 0px !important; box-shadow: none !important;\"><a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2016/prop67-fig1.png\" target=\"_blank\">Figure 1</a></p>", "official_impartial_analysis_author": "Legislative Analyst's Office", "official_tax_rate": "", "official_tax_rate_author": "", "official_short_arguments_yes": "", "official_short_arguments_no": "", "official_short_arguments_source": "", "official_rebuttal_yes": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">WE ALL WANT TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT, BUT PROP. 67 IS A FRAUD.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is a $300 million per year HIDDEN BAG TAX on California consumers who will be forced to pay a minimum 10 cents for every paper and thick plastic grocery bag they are given at checkout.
