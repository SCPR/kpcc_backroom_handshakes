What's covered?
--------------

* The June election will include two types of primaries, so media clients will need to account for two files containing election results. One file will contain election results for the presidential primary contests; the other file will contain election results for U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, State Senate, and State Assembly primary contests, and one state ballot measure


* The election night data files are created approximately every five minutes after the polls close at 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Election Day. There may be longer periods of time during which some counties show no updates because each of the 58 county elections offices processes ballots differently. County elections officials are required to send initial results to the Secretary of State's office no more than two hours after they begin tallying the votes (no later than 10:00 p.m.). Data files will be generated until all counties have reported final numbers for the semi-official canvass.
